ROOT FOLDER = ./
Set the GALOIS_ROOT to appropriate directory in your machine. (modifiy the CPU-Galois/comm.mk file)
If Galois is not installed, comment the Make of Galois-codes in MakeFile in ROOT DIRECTORY.
Do a make from ROOT DIRECTORY.
dsl codes in apps folder will be compiled to C++/CUDA code and written in CPU/GPU/CPU-Galois folders under ROOT FOLDER.
then these codes will be compiled to binaries and written to bin folder under ROOT FOLDER.

input graph should be in .gr format. convertion of edgelist to .gr can be done with code unde folder utility.
edgelist format has following syntax with edges sorted in ascending order of src vertex.
npoints nedges (line 0)
src dst weight (line 1 to nedges)

Morph algorithm
For dynamic sssp addition of edges should be given as a text file. input graph should be in .gr format.

For DMR algorithm the inputs and node files and preprocessed nbrs files.
if command line argument to dmr is r25k , inputs expected by algorithm are r25k.node,r25k.ele,r25.poly,r25k.nbr


known issues

1) type checking is not perfect.
2) mst code of CPU-Galois do not print mst-cost,computed cost is correct.
3)  CPU mst needs graph to be in symmetric format
